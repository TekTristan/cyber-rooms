1.) put ip in browser, went deeper into the page source to find the username
	- R1ckRul3s

2.) started nmap scan
	- nmap -sC -sV 10.10.127.42
	- found ports 22 and 80 are open 

3.) used gobuster to find hidden directories and/or files that could help me find the password and login
	- gobuster dir -u ip -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,sh, txt,cgi,html,css,js,py
		- finding all directories and extensions hidden for passwords or clues

4.) foudn assets and login.php and portal.php
	- login.php where i used the username

		- got stuck for a bit then used ip/robots.txt since is a it a normal and common place in the webserver and could have clues.		
			- and the password was there

5.) login into the portal, where it asks for commands so i assumed linux commands would work.
	-entered ls to find all thf iles including the first ingredient

6.) tried different directories with ls like ls /root  and found using ls /home to find rick and linux folders
	- went into rick to find the second command, but commands are disabled including cat to open files
		- tried vim and that didnt work, so research later 'less' works'
				- less '/home/rick/second ingredient'

7.) since i tried to get root with ls /root and that didnt work, sudo -l helped me escalate my privleges, kinda.
	- where it gave an error basically saying that using sudo in any command would bypass anything that needed a password
		- so i reached the conclusion to use sudo ls/root, then found 3rd.txt, cant open it normally so used less to open it
				- sudo less ls/root/3rd.txt
